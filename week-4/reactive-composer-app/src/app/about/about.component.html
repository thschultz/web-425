            <h3>Hans Zimmer</h3>
            <p>Hans Zimmer is a German Film Score composer and music producer. He was born in Frankfurt, Germany on
                September 12, 1957. He began his career early by playing the piano. Not being a fan of traditional
                teachings, he started to learn by himself. He admired Ennio Morricone and wanted to become a film
                composer. He composed some of the biggest movies including; The Lion King, Inception, The Dark Knight,
                Interstellar, and Dune. He also produces and composes sounds for BMWâ€™s electric car line.</p>
